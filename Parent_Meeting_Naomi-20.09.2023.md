# Misc. Notes about this Year
- A lot of the same time slots for same subjects in the timetable.
- More study time.
- More Ganztag time.
- There's a scented candle which helps create a calm atmosphere during study time.
- Sport and art lessons are now assisted by Mr. Nicholson.
- Children are asked to come to school wearing their sport clothes on the days when there's a PE lesson.
- Avoid congestion in the school yard during pickup time.
- This year there will be more time to take field trips as there's no A/B week split. In other words, there's now no mandatory project day every second week.
- **On school trip days there will be no lunch provided by the school. Parents should make sure that children take an appropriate lunch with them.**
- No electronic devices including smart watches.
- Write the dates in children's homework books in advance. It makes it much easier for the children to write things down in the right spot.
- **If a child goes home alone on a regular basis or a regular day, we can email Mr. Nicholson and he can put it in the system so that we don't have to pout this in the homework planner every time.**
- Sprinkles is still around.
# Behaviour

## Homesickness during Class Trip
- Try to prepare the children for a long separation (several days) in advance.
>[!Question]
>	- Q: Should the children have some cash with them?
>	- A: Ms Parr and Mr. Nicholson will think of a system where the team will keep all the money and perhaps hand it out if there's a nice place to spend it. As opposed to having a free for all at a sweet shop.
