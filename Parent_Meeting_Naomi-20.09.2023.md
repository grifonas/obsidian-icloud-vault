# Notes about Changes this Year
- A lot of the same time slots for same subjects in the timetable.
- More study time.
- More Ganztag time.
- There's a scented candle which helps create a calm atmosphere during study time.
- Sport and art lessons are now assisted by Mr. Nicholson.
- Children are asked to come to school wearing their sport clothes on the days when there's a PE lesson.
- This year there will be more time to take field trips as there's no A/B week split. IN other words, there's now no mandatory project day every second week.
- **On school trip days there will be no lunch provided by the school. So parents should give children an appropriate lunch.**
- No electronic devices including smart watches.
- Write the dates in children's homework books in advance. It makes it much easier for the children to write things down in the right spot.
- **If a child goes home alone on a regular basis or a regular day, we can email Mr. Nicholson and he can put it in the system so that we don't have to pout this in the homework planner every time.**
- Sprinkles is still around.
# Behaviour
- There's still the school policy for behaviour reflection tasks in exceptional  cases (almost never happens in our class).

# Assessments
- Quizzes
- Tests
- Exams
- The children will be putting their grades in their homework books.
## Leaf Score for Social and Work Behaviour
- 4 leaves - over and beyond what's expected.
- 3 - meets the expectations consistently.
- 2 - meets the expectations but inconsistently.
- 1 - does not meet expectations.

## Homesickness during Class Trip
- Try to prepare the children for a long separation (several days) in advance.
>[!Question]
>	- Q: Should the children have some cash with them?
>	- A: Ms Parr and Mr. Nicholson will think of a system where the team will keep all the money and perhaps hand it out if there's a nice place to spend it. As opposed to having a free for all at a sweet shop.
