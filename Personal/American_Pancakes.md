# Thick Pancakes

Originally [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkcHmpKxFwg), I halved it.

## Ingredients and Method

- 1.5 cups of flour
- 1/8 cups of sugar
- 0.75 tsp salt
- 0.5 tbsp baking powder
- 0.75 tsp baking soda
- Mix the dry ingredients with a whisk.
- 1.125 cups of milk
- 1/8 oil
- A bit of vanilla
- 1/8 apple cider vinegar
- 2 eggs (small, cause in the original recipe there's 3 and this is a halved version)
- Mix the wet and the dry. The usual: only about 20 times. Do not over-mix. #recipe
- Warm up the pan at mark 4 more or less
- Pop some butter on it. It's OK if it gets a bit brown
- Yada- yada. Done
