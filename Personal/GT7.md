## Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps - 1 Hour

- **GT-R Nismo GT500 ‘16** felt like cheating. Two stop on Fuel map 1, and mostly stopped for tires. Easily could be a 1 stop race if tires weren’t an issue. Ran it with hards and it stuck to the track well. Stopped between laps 10-11 for fuel and hards, and then between laps 20-21 for fuel and intermediates. Spun out three times and messed up by not switching to intermediates between laps 19-20 when it started raining. My lap time on that lap was 4:10, my normal lap time was between 2:16-2:19 consistently. Still managed to win by a minute and a half.
