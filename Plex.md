## Installed Directly on Pi4
Note that this a completely new Plex account.

DNS: http://plex-pi4.local.gkon.link:32400/
Login: Apple (hide my email grifkon@gmail.com)


### Adding Libraries
After a fresh install first go to the **IP, NOT THE DNS**!
Going to the DNS will result in the prompts to **"Get Media Server"**


## Pi4-K8S
Scaled the deployment down to 0.
